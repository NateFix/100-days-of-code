# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Just reacquainting with tools (Sublime/GitHub/CodePen) and resources (primarily FreeCodeCamp) after several weeks inactivity.  Completed github hello-world tutorial and forked/updated this repo. Browsed my Free Code Camp map to get up to speed with past progress. Aiming to complete the Front End Certification at least within the next 100 days.  Completed Day 1 of Wes Boss' 30 Days of Vanilla JS (JavaScript Drumkit). Spent a good 3-4 hours tinkering this evening.

**Thoughts:**  Already learning new things from the first Wes Boss tut, playing with audio and related keyboard events.  Keen to learn more about audio and the Web Audio API to incorporate into a future soundboard/app project.  First week will likely be guided tutorials and FreeCodeCamp exercises to regain familiarity before focussing on completing the Front End Certification projects.

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Less free time today.   Completed Day 2 of Wes Boss' 30 Days of Vanilla JS (JavaScript & CSS Clock). Revisited lectures and exercises from the DOM Manipulation section of Colt Steele's exellent Udemy "Web Developer Bootcamp" course.

**Thoughts:**  After a few weeks off of regular coding my Sublime Text game is really sluggish, forgotten shortcuts etc.  Hopefully will be back up to some emblance of speed within a few days.  Thinking of subject matter and content to get onto the FreeCodeCamp tribute page ASAP.  Wes Boss course already raising plenty of unfamiliar material, I could easily spend hours thoroughly digesting each tutorial and solution but will try not to get too bogged down and focus on my own projects.
