# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Just reacquainting with tools (Sublime/GitHub/CodePen) and resources (primarily FreeCodeCamp) after several weeks inactivity.  Completed github hello-world tutorial and forked/updated this repo. Browsed my Free Code Camp map to get up to speed with past progress. Aiming to complete the Front End Certification at least within the next 100 days.  Completed Day 1 of Wes Boss' 30 Days of Vanilla JS (JavaScript Drumkit). Spent a good 3-4 hours tinkering this evening.

**Thoughts:**  Already learning new things from the first Wes Boss tut, playing with audio and related keyboard events.  Keen to learn more about audio and the Web Audio API to incorporate into a future soundboard/app project.  First week will likely be guided tutorials and FreeCodeCamp exercises to regain familiarity before focussing on completing the Front End Certification projects.

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Less free time today.   Completed Day 2 of Wes Boss' 30 Days of Vanilla JS (JavaScript & CSS Clock). Revisited lectures and exercises from the DOM Manipulation section of Colt Steele's exellent Udemy "Web Developer Bootcamp" course.

**Thoughts:**  After a few weeks off of regular coding my Sublime Text game is really sluggish, forgotten shortcuts etc.  Hopefully will be back up to some emblance of speed within a few days.  Thinking of subject matter and content to get onto the FreeCodeCamp tribute page ASAP.  Wes Bos course already raising plenty of unfamiliar material, I could easily spend hours thoroughly digesting each tutorial and solution but will try not to get too bogged down and focus on my own projects.

### Day 2: January 5th, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**:   Completed Day 3 of Wes Bos' 30 Days of Vanilla JS (Playing with CSS variables and JS). Spent a couple hours tinkering and reviewing all 3 days solutions, trying (and for the most part failing) to recreate the unfamiliar CSS and JS code snippets.  Also reviewed the new community section set up in Wes' repo and compared notes.

**Thoughts:**  So much to learn, but enjoying these tutorials immensely.  While I'm aware that this 100 day challenge is ideally for working on projects, I'm realising the bulk of my time will still likely be spent immersed in tutorials and exercises.  I have a heavy schedule of courses to work thru (primarily the Frontend Masters track), with regular check-ins at Free Code Camp along the way and at least a weekly Codewars kata session to gauge progress...

### Day 3: January 6th, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**:   Completed Day 4 of Wes Bos' 30 Days of Vanilla JS (Array Cardio Day 1). An amazing tutorial, such a great idea too honing in on arrays.  I struggled to complete any of these myself without assistance, let alone using the ES6 features in the given solutions.  Revisited the Colt Steele array tutorial and reviewed my FreeCodeCamp solutions using the array methods covered.  A solid couple hours at least put in today.

**Thoughts:**  Much the same as yesterday.  I've also bookmarked Wes Bos' ES6 course for future study.  Enjoying his teaching a lot.  Despite feeling still very inept am aware that have covered a lot of ground in just a few short months and to keep at it.

### Day 4: January 7th, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**:   Light day today as sunny afternoon turned into early Summer evening drinks...  Did however managed to find a good resource for reviewing differences between ES5 and ES6. Axel Rauschmayer's "Exploring ES6", specifically (http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_core-features.html). Definitely needed this.

**Thoughts:**  Looking forward to doing some form of coding or study daily already. Glad I took this opportunity.

### Day 5: January 8th, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  Another light day.  Completed JavaScript 30 Day 5 - Flex Panel Image Gallery. Queued up the first five Frontend Masters lectures on the 'Beginner Developer' curriculum to work thru over the rest of Jan.

**Thoughts:**  Really enjoying JS30 tutorials but hugely overwhelmed (and equally inspired) by all the new stuff.  Staying focussed on the fundamentals.

### Day 6 (...and Day 7): January 9th/10th, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**:  Another late night turned into early morning session.  Completed Javascript 30 Day 6 - Ajax Type Ahead.  Really useful tutorial.  First review of regular expressions since Free Code Camp exercises some months back.

**Thoughts:** Need to make an earlier start, past 2 days have been late night/early a.m and shorter sessions than I would like.  It is my kids school holidays though so...  

### Day 7 (...and Day 8): January 10th/11th, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**:  Another late night ...  Completed Javascript 30 Day 7 - Array Cardio Day 2.  Started Frontend Masters "Introduction to Web Development" video tutorial, but sleep got the better of me a few mins in.  More tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Loving this Wes Bos course so much.  So much to learn, in the CSS alone let alone the actual JS instruction, ES6 etc.  Going to revisit the material again and try and redo from memory in the near future.
