# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Just reacquainting with tools (Sublime/GitHub/CodePen) and resources (primarily FreeCodeCamp) after several weeks inactivity.  Completed github hello-world tutorial and forked/updated this repo. Browsed my Free Code Camp map to get up to speed with past progress. Aiming to complete the Front End Certification at least within the next 100 days.  Completed Day 1 of Wes Boss' 30 Days of Vanilla JS (JavaScript Drumkit). Spent a good 3-4 hours tinkering this evening.

**Thoughts:**  Already learning new things from the first Wes Boss tut, playing with audio and related keyboard events.  Keen to learn more about audio and the Web Audio API to incorporate into a future soundboard/app project.  First week will likely be guided tutorials and FreeCodeCamp exercises to regain familiarity before focussing on completing the Front End Certification projects.
