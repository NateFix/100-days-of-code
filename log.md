# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Just reacquainting with tools (Sublime/GitHub/CodPen) and resources (primarily FreeCodeCamp) after several weeks inactivity.  Completed github hello-world tutorial and forked/updated this repo. Browsed my Free Code Camp map to get up to speed with past progress. Aiming to complete the Front End Certification at least within the next 100 days.  Completed Day 1 of Wes Boss' 30 Days of Vanilla JS (JavaScript Drumkit).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
